### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Charles and I am a passionate software developer. 
I have been working on non open source companies my entire life, so I can't show you what I am working at here.

I started programming in BASIC, then in Clipper, Visual Basic, Delphi, ABAP, C/C++, PHP, Java until I found the most productive language for me: C#, which I knew in its 1.0 version and never abandoned. Nowadays I'm learning Python to develop artificial intelligence programs.
